				<H2>Wings of Wax in the Subprime Meltdown</H2>
				  <P>in 1999 I started to build what would later become the biggest subprime loan search engine, LenderLab.com. Ten years later subprime lending had decimated the economy. It seemed like a good idea at the time.</P>
				 <h2>Looting</h2>
				  <p>My friend Lance told me about a treasure map to some stolen Nazi loot. We decided to make a film about it. We never actually found the gold but we found half a million dollars in a guys closet.</P>
