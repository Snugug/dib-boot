				<H2>Wings of Wax in the Subprime Meltdown</H2>
				  <P>in 1999 I started to build what would later become the biggest subprime loan search engine, LenderLab.com. Ten years later subprime lending had decimated the economy, but it had seemed like a good idea at the time.</P>
				 <h2>Looting</h2>
				  <p>My friend Lance told me about a treasure map to some stolen Nazi loot. We decided to make a film about him trying to find it. We never actually found the gold but we accidently found about half a million dollars hidding in an old guys closet. Sold it to HBO.</P>
