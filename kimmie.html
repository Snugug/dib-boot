				<h2>About</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Kimmie is a visual designer and artist based in New York City.</p> 
			<p>Her father—a South Vietnamese fighter pilot—emigrated to America, and by stroke of luck ran into her mother in a refugee camp. Sometime in the 90s, he taught Kimmie her ABCs on a machine running DOS. Her mother taught Kimmie to draw mermaids to keep her from rearranging the furniture. <i>She was only trying to optimize the flow of the room befor better TV-viewing!</i></p>
			<p>In 2004, Kimmie took a Journalism class and learned how to thumbnail newspaper layouts. It was a match made in Pagemaker.</p>
			<p>Her teacher insisted on the following:</p>
			<blockquote>"Design! Don't Decorate!"</blockquote>
			<p>This has worked out OK—except Fall 2008, when she made her first site-specific art installation.</p>
