      <h2 id="hh"> History </h2>
      <p>A year ago I bought a 48x60 inches canvas. Why did I buy it? Because it was on sale. But soon I realized how difficult to find a subject for my painting. Nothing seemed to fit that big canvas. A friend of mine suggested that I should do an abstract painting - No one will be able to understand or judge it. Maybe I should listen to her.

      <h2 id="hmi">Main Impressionists</h2>
      <p>Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists. Their independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s, in spite of harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.</p>
      <p>Impressionist painting characteristics include relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.</p>
