      <h2> What should I paint? </h2>
      <p>A year ago I bought a 48x60 inches canvas. Why did I buy it? Because it was on sale. But soon I realized how difficult to find a subject for my painting. Nothing seemed to fit that big canvas. A friend of mine suggested that I should do an abstract painting - No one will be able to understand or judge it. Maybe I should listen to her.</p>
