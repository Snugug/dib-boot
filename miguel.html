	  <p>My full name is Captain Awesomeness Migs Shufflebottom, I'm named after my uncle the famous <a href="http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/3300000/Dog-dog-the-bounty-hunter-3308558-1440-900.jpg" >bounty hunter</a>., you won't have heard of him since all evidence of his work was covered up during the cold war. In my spare time I enjoy the touch of the wind on my face, walks on the beach and extensive conversations. I would live to share my favorite quote with you: <blockquote>"Friendship is like peeing on yourself: everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling that it brings." <i>~Unknown</i> </blockquote></p>

	  <h2>Some more stuff about ME</h2>
	  <p>I always try to cheer myself up by singing when I get down. But most of the time, it turns out that my voice is worse than my problems.</p>
	  <p>I consider myself a crayon, I might not be your favorite color but one day you'll need me to complete your picture. When I die, I want to go peacefully like my Grandfather did, in his sleep - not screaming, like the passengers in his car.</p>
