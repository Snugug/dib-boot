        </header>
            <p> I am a Designer & Developer currently living in Brooklyn and working in Manhattan. Whether you consider
                me a designer with programming skills, or a programmer with a knack for beautiful design, my diverse
                skill set is what allows me to holistically solve problems. Besides programming and design,
                I am also a blogger, photographer and social media marketer. I believe that one of
                life's greatest pleasures is creation, no matter your medium of choice.</p>

            All of my work can be seen on my <a href="http://wwww.erindepew.com">personal website</a>. Of course, the new
            cobbler's children is the programmer's website, so it needs a little love right now.
